# MY-FIRST-REPO
Just a Test repo for experimenting with github version control
		
	Hello World,

	This is my first Git repository to get started with Git. I have linked my local test project to this repo.

	I am a graduate from the University of California Santa Cruz, US in Bioinformatics.
I have worked as a Research Engineer doing protein prediction. 

	Github has a wonderful community that I would love to help contribute to.
So I decided to join Git and as a Hello World task, here is my first GIT repo. I seek your help and support to better understand Git. 
Hopefully this is just a beginning of my wonderful journey in open source community.
